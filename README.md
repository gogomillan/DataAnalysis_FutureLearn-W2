Project 2: Holiday weather

by Rob Griffiths, 11 September 2015, updated 11 April 2017

This is the project notebook for Week 2 of The Open University's Learn to code for Data Analysis course.

There is nothing I like better than taking a holiday. In the winter I like to have a two week break in a country where I can be guaranteed sunny dry days. In the summer I like to have two weeks off relaxing in my garden in London. However I'm often disappointed because I pick a fortnight when the weather is dull and it rains. So in this project I am going to use the historic weather data from the Weather Underground for London to try to predict two good weather weeks to take off as holiday next summer. Of course the weather in the summer of 2016 may be very different to 2014 but it should give me some indication of when would be a good time to take a summer break.

**Remember If you want to execute the project, you should have installed the Anaconda package 3 with IPython Notebook. http://http://www.open.edu/openlearn/learn-to-code-installation
